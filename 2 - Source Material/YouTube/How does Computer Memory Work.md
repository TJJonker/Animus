DRAM is an abbreviation for Dynamic Random Access Memory, which is otherwise known as 'main memory' or 'working memory'.  In order to use data, it needs to be moved from any long term storage module to the DRAM. 

long term storage permanently stores data in massive 3D arrays, while DRAM temporarily stores data in 2D arrays. Fetching data from SSD's can take 50 microseconds (10)
