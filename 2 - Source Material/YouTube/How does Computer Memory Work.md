DRAM is an abbreviation for Dynamic Random Access Memory, which is otherwise known as 'main memory' or 'working memory'.  In order to use data, it needs to be moved from any long term storage module to the DRAM. 

Long term storage permanently stores data in massive 3D arrays, while DRAM temporarily stores data in 2D arrays. Fetching data from an SSD can take 50 microseconds (10$^-$$^6$ seconds), while fetching data from DRAM takes 17 nanoseconds (10$^-$$^9$ seconds), which makes DRAM data fetching about 3000 times faster. 

Downsides of DRAM is that it requires power to maintain and refresh its data, and that it stores a single bit per memory cell in a 2D array. Because of the power requirement, shutting down the computer will reset DRAM data. Regarding the storage, storing a single bit per memory cell is space inefficient, requiring large physical space on the module to store bigger chunks of data.
