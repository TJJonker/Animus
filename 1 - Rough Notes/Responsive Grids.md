# Grids and Columns
Rows are used for vertical axis. They're used for consistency when working with the 8-pt grid system. It could be any number, but you should be sticking to the amount of rows. When using the 8-pt grid system, often the size and gutter are set to 8 to keep in line with the layout system.

> In Figma, this is created through the Layout Guide when a frame is selected. Additionally, a Layout Guide can be transformed into style to be applied in project-wide frames.


# 12 Column Layout
Web standard applies a horizontal layout with 12 segments. 12 Is easily divisible, allowing for division by 2, 3, 4, and 6.
